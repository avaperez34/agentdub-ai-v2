<h1>Signal #003</h1>
<h2>Industrial AI Moves from Dashboards to Autonomous Decision Loops</h2>

<p>
In industrial contexts (energy, utilities, logistics, and large facilities), AI is moving beyond “visibility dashboards” into autonomous decision loops. Instead of only monitoring KPIs, systems now recommend or execute actions such as maintenance scheduling, load balancing, anomaly response, and routing—often with human-in-the-loop controls.
</p>

<h3>Why it matters</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Operational ROI:</b> Decision loops create measurable outcomes (downtime reduction, efficiency gains) rather than passive reporting.</li>
  <li><b>Governance becomes mandatory:</b> Autonomy requires audit trails, guardrails, and incident response playbooks.</li>
  <li><b>Vendor differentiation:</b> Winners provide integration, reliability, and observability—not just models.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What to watch next</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Which sectors adopt first (utilities, ports, airports, energy).</li>
  <li>Emergence of agent monitoring/controls as a procurement line item.</li>
  <li>Partnerships between AI vendors and OT/industrial incumbents.</li>
</ul>
