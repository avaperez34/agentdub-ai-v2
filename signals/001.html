<h1>Signal #001</h1>
<h2>Agentic AI Deployed at Scale in Abu Dhabi Logistics</h2>

<p>
AD Ports Group has deployed agentic AI capabilities across logistics operations in Abu Dhabi. The shift is notable because it indicates movement beyond pilots: AI systems are being integrated into operational workflows where decisioning, routing, exception handling, and optimization can run continuously with human oversight.

</ul>
